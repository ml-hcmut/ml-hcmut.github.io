# Generative Adversarial Networks 
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), inspired by the game theory, was first introduced in 2014 [(Goodfellow, et.al.)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2014/hash/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Abstract.html). GAN is a likelihood-free framework to estimate a deep generative models, and have been applied to solve so many interesting real world problems such as super-resolution, text-to-image synthesize, image inpainting, etc. In this blog, we will investigate how GANs work and the theory behind them.

## **Why GANs?**

## **Adversarial Network**
In this new framework for learning a generative models via an **adversarial** **training**, we will simutaneously train two models: the generative model that will capture the target distribution of data (then we can sample from) and the discriminative model that will assign a probability to determine whether a sample comes from the generator or the target distribution. In the other words, the generator is trained to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator need to correctly classify real samples and generated samples
